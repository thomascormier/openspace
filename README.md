## Object Recognition Algorithm
If you want to test this feature, you will need the file object_recognition.py, [yolov3.cfg](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg) and [yolov3.weights](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights). Make sure to give your terminal an access to your webcam. Then, open a terminal from your project repository and use the command:
```
python object_recognition.py
```
